XVal
====

XVal is a utility to display recorded security events from an Xbox 360 console. When given a console serial number along with the 'X' value from System Info in the Dashboard, XVal can determine whether or not that console is flagged for a violation. This is an Android implementation of Redline99's XVal, suitable for checking used 360s in stores.

The canonical repository for XVal is hosted at [cooltrainer.org/source](https://cooltrainer.org/source/). The GitHub remote is for social features like pull requests.
